to install react-router use the following as it does not come with the normal bundle:

    npm i react-router-dom@5

    Then we need to import some things into the App.js.

    We destructure them so we can use them using this name i.e. BrowserRouter or i.e. Router or i.e. Switch inside this file

    import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

    Then we need to surround the entire application with the router componenent so we can use the router component in the entire application.
    i.e. all components that are nested inside of the the App.js component so all componenents have access to the router.

    The next thing is to decide to where we want out page content to go when we go to different pages. We want it to go inside this <div> with a class of content

    <div className="content">

    so we delete the <Home> component

       <Home />

    and replace it with the <Switch> component

    The switch component makes sure that only one route is shown at any one time.

    For now all our routes go inside this switch component.

    Then we add our individual routes - so we create a route for each page that we have using the Route compoonent we destructured above.

    i.e. a route with a property of the path that the route uses so for home "/".

    It is the bit after co.uk ONLY  .../home

     <Route path='/'>

    </Route>

    Then put the component in the middle

    <Route path='/'>
        <Home />
    </Route>

    To stop it matching if the first bit is included in the route we added exact prop

     <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/">
            <Home />
        </Route>
        <Route path="/create">
            <Create />
        </Route>
    </Switch>

    THE SWITCH COMPONENT
    REACT LOOKS FOR THE FIRST MATCH AND RENDERS THAT THEN STOPS if you don't use switch then it would carry on and render any other matches as well.

    The way it is setup then the next page is requested from the server. To stop it doing this and make it handle in the broswer like React
    should we need to use react router <Link> instead rather than <a> tags
